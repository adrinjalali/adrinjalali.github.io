Title: A Central Cancer Diagnostics Hub

### Motivation

- Reproducibility crisis
- Re-inventing the wheel (many times)
- Gap between research and clinics

### Solution
The idea is to have a place facilitating method development as well as their usage. To understand the proposed system, we can consider three players or stakeholders in the game.

One is the programmer, or the bioinformatician. As a programmer, you can use certain simple APIs in several programming languages, to deliver tasks related to cancer diagnostics. These tasks are steps along the way of the analysis. Pre-processing of the data is one step. So is predicting the sub-class of the cancer for instance. Once the programmer uploads their method, it is automatically run against all the available data-sets in the system.

Another player in the game is an oncologist, or whoever in the need for a suggestion of a diagnosis for a given sample. Hospitals and clinics for instance, can use the system to run different trained methods against the data taken from their individual sample. This can improve and help diagnosis through time.

And the last player, but not the least, is the lab producing data. The data can be added to the system, to have the back-end run different existing algorithms against the newly acquired data-set.

### Practicalities
