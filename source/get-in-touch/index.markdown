#### Social networks
You can find me as adrin.jalali or adrinjalali on Twitter, G+, FB and probably 
some other places. But none of them are my preferred means of communication with
people I don't personally know.

#### Blogs
If you are looking for an official blog of mine, you are surfing it right now.

If you are curious to know what I would probably say outside work, you
can check out
[Adrin - The Idiot](http://adrintheidiot.blogspot.com/), which is currently 
my most active blog. But I also have 
[Mazdayasn](http://mazdayasn.blogspot.com/) which is mostly in my mother
tongue i.e. Persian.

The above two blogs are my personal thoughts and can not be cited as
what I would say in an official situation. They might be far from
being politically right, and I take no responsibility over them.
