&lt;p&gt;On June 2nd I received an email from my adviser telling me about the &lt;a href="https://www.synapse.org/Portal.html#!Challenges:DREAM"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DREAM&lt;/span&gt; Challenges&lt;/a&gt;. I kind of liked it as some sub-challenges fit exactly what I&amp;#8217;ve been doing for that past few months, and that project is already in a phase that we&amp;#8217;ve submitted a manuscript about it. So why&amp;nbsp;not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through their pages, I realized they&amp;#8217;ve got a python client to interact with their databases; that&amp;#8217;s cool, but it didn&amp;#8217;t support python 3. As a result I made &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient/pull/150"&gt;this pull request&lt;/a&gt; and at the moment of writing this post, they seem to be interested in accepting the commits (although the changes are not perfect and/or complete and more work is&amp;nbsp;required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I was reading challenge descriptions which made me interact with the website for a while, and that made me a bit frustrated. I have to say, I&amp;#8217;m not a web-developer and I&amp;#8217;m talking as a simple end&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was the web-site&amp;#8217;s development manager, I&amp;#8217;d add these to the first possible &lt;a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2007/march/glossary-of-scrum-terms#1118"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a proper navigation system to the website; currently you can only easily navigate within a challenge/project. You need to go to the home page first to go anywhere&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to go to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DREAM&lt;/span&gt; challenges, you need to go to the home page, wait for that timer based frame to come which has the link to the challenge, click on it. In my browser (chromium), I have to refresh the whole page if I miss it once, or wait for it to come again. So: add proper links, menus, or whatever you think suits the framework for a nice navigation to&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within a challenge description page, click on a link and the whole page will be reloaded, slowly and painfully. For some reason the layout of the page changes through time after each part of the page is loaded. A simple markdown based static website works much faster and better, if you want it to be fancy, add proper &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AJAX&lt;/span&gt; components/codes to make it smooth and fast. The website has serious performance issues and seems unnecessarily&amp;nbsp;heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure developers have their reason for having the website the way it is, but those reasons must be&amp;nbsp;justified/changed.&lt;/p&gt;</summary></entry></feed>
