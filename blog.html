<p>This is a repost of what I posted on
<a href="https://twitter.com/adrinjalali/status/1217434403044876288">twitter</a>.</p>
<p>At NeurIPS @celestekidd gave a keynote on how people form their beliefs. It was
amazing, and had two plot twists which made the audience stand and clap at the
end; something you don&#8217;t see often in academic conferences. Here&#8217;s a summary,
and I love how it&nbsp;ends.</p>
<p>1/ Humans continuously form beliefs. These beliefs are constantly updated. In a
sense, our beliefs are probabilistic expectations which directly influence what
we&#8217;re interested&nbsp;in.</p>
<p>Things which cause a very low, or a very high surprise level, are usually not
interesting to&nbsp;us.</p>
<p>For instance, there&#8217;s a low chance that I&#8217;d enjoy a book teaching the English
alphabet, or a book in a language I don&#8217;t understand, and is in an alphabet I
don&#8217;t know, and...

<p>Almost a year ago, after being the co-speaker of a &#8220;My first open source
contribution&#8221; talk at PyData Berlin 2018, I myself became very motivated and
started actively contributing to the <code>scikit-learn</code> project. I was surprised to
see how much I could and had to learn to improve my contributions, and that was
after over 20 years of programming experience, 6 years of which I did mostly
Python, and several years of working in the industry. It wasn&#8217;t even the first
time I was contributing to an open source project, but it was the first time I
was actively looking for issues to&nbsp;fix.</p>
<p>One of the reasons I stayed on the project, was the extremely nice and patient
attitude of the reviewers and core developers of the project, most importantly,
Joel Nothman. I felt welcomed, tutored, and guided throughout my contributions.
Of course it also required my patience, since some of the...

<p>Writing code is not the only way you can contribute to an open source project.
Like any other project, there are many tasks which are not programming, but are
required to push the project forward, and many programmers are not even
necessarily good at those tasks. Think of organizing meetups, <span class="caps">UI</span>/<span class="caps">UX</span> design,
documentation, and translation as some examples. You can read more about these

<p>This post is by far not an exhaustive list of what can be done, rather what I
have personally been engaged with. Let&#8217;s assume you start using a piece of
software as a library in of your projects, and through time you want to get
engaged with it&nbsp;more.</p>

<p>When looking for a project to which you&#8217;d like to contribute, there are two
major aspects you may want to consider. One is the way it&#8217;s released and
managed, and the other is the community around&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The way I see the first aspect, it&#8217;s like a spectrum. Closed source proprietary
software on one side (let say the right side), and community driven and fully 
transparent and open
sourced project on the other side (let say the left side).
And it&#8217;s important to realize that different
projects are somewhere on this spectrum, and not necessarily on either of the
two ends; let aside the whole licensing issue which itself complicates matters
by another order of&nbsp;magnitude.</p>
<p>Sometimes companies &#8220;release&#8221; the source code of a product, or a part of a
product. Microsoft does this...

<p>I&#8217;ve been a fan of open source software for a long time. However, up until
recently, I wasn&#8217;t seriously contributing to any specific project; but why
would you want to contribute to an open source project in the first&nbsp;place?</p>
<p>There are a few different aspects to be taken into account here, and here I try
to go through some of&nbsp;them.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Help the community</strong> by contributing to the project. This is the one which
   comes to one&#8217;s mind the most. You like a product, or a community around a
   particular software, hence you contribute to that particular software. Doing
   so, you help yourself (if you use the software) and everybody else who uses
   that same&nbsp;product.</li>
<li><strong>Help the larger community</strong> by advocating and normalizing open source
   contributions. When you contribute to open source projects, you become yet

I attended a hackathon called
<a href="https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/International-financing/KfW-Development-Bank/Topics/Health/Hacking-Global-Health/">Hacking Global Health</a>.
We were nearly 40 people, in about 20 teams, and each team had to pitch an idea
in 2 minutes. The only constraint on the ideas was that it had to do with
improving health in poor urban areas. The trick was that only 8 of these teams
were supposed to go to the &#8220;next&#8221; round and develop those ideas for the final
pitch. But that was supposed to happen organically, without any...

<p>I put this study in the same category as studies trying to argue women are different than men, usually in derogatory ways, e.g. proving they&#8217;re weaker, less intelligent, or worse at math. Recently we had the google engineer citing a whole bunch of them to support his argument about why men are better coders, or men are better in tech, or whatever bullshit he wanted to argue for. Honestly I won&#8217;t bother reading it; I mostly heard about it in podcasts and read about it in the news. My point is, those gender related studies tend to be more damaging than beneficial, and I see no point in doing them. I understand this is a very consequentialist way of assessing the value of...

<p>To me, a hackathon is when a group of people gather for a day or two, working for a somewhat common goal, develop, have fun, meet new people, and to home. Unfortunately for whatever reason, most hackathons have become a competition, with a set prize, organized by some company. The good part is that some attendees might get some money out of the hackathon, but the down side is that it usually becomes a competition and people stop collaborating. I was very happy to see that was not very the case in this hackathon, and we had mostly a really nice atmosphere for the whole weekend. It was a pleasurable experience working and chatting with Clue and WATTx people as well as the&nbsp;attendees.</p>

<p>This work was done in <a href="https://corporate.misterspex.com/en/">Mister Spex GmbH</a>, and slides of a presentation I gave at <a href="https://www.meetup.com/PyData-Berlin/events/235347104/">PyData meetup</a> are available now <a href="/files/tv-gp-pydata-presentation.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>There is a website, in this case an e-shop, and we have information about user sessions on the website. We also have information about <span class="caps">TV</span>-ads shown to the public requested by the company. The question is, which of those sessions on the website are there because of the <span class="caps">TV</span>-ads.</p>
<p>There are some obstacles to answer the above&nbsp;question:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users don&#8217;t tell the website why they came to the website, or how they found about the&nbsp;service.</li>
<li>Users use different channels to get to the website. They might have seen an ad on <span class="caps">TV</span>...

<p>I was reading <a href="http://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21661651-new-technique-manipulating-genes-holds-great-promisebut-rules-are-needed-govern-its">this article</a> on the ethics of editing human genome and I realized there&#8217;s a missing point in&nbsp;there.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR"><span class="caps">CRISPR</span></a> in short is a technology that allows us to edit our own genome. Of course it has countless number of useful applications as it&#8217;s very simply depicted in the above picture (credit: economist). But recently Chinese scientists have genetically modified human embryos (<a href="http://www.nature.com/news/chinese-scientists-genetically-modify-human-embryos-1.17378">link</a>). Fortunately...

                <p>After quite a few days struggling to configure a Zimbra server so that it automatically fetches users from our freeIPA (<span class="caps">LDAP</span>) server, I finally managed to have a configuration which works. I got help from a bunch of pages like <a href="http://imanudin.net/2014/12/09/zimbra-external-ad-automatically-create-mailboxes-zimbra-with-lazy-mode-auto-provisioning/">this</a> and <a href="https://www.zimbra.com/docs/ne/8.0.2/administration_guide/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm#href=ZCS_8_0_2_Admin_Guide.Auto_Provisioning_New_Accounts_from_External_LDAP.html">this</a> one. This comes after you fix the external <span class="caps">LDAP</span> authentication and probably also external <span class="caps">GAL</span> configuration on your Zimbra&nbsp;server.</p>
<p><code>zmprov</code> gives you a nice terminal to configure the&nbsp;server:</p>

                <p>I decided to actually write on this blog (decision was made this morning and is final :D&nbsp;).</p>
<p>On June 2nd I received an email from my adviser telling me about the <a href="https://www.synapse.org/Portal.html#!Challenges:DREAM"><span class="caps">DREAM</span> Challenges</a>. I kind of liked it as some sub-challenges fit exactly what I&#8217;ve been doing for that past few months, and that project is already in a phase that we&#8217;ve submitted a manuscript about it. So why&nbsp;not?</p>
<p>Going through their pages, I realized they&#8217;ve got a python client to interact with their databases; that&#8217;s cool, but it didn&#8217;t support python 3. As a result I made <a href="https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient/pull/150">this pull request</a> and at the moment of writing this post, they seem to be interested in accepting the commits (although the changes are not perfect and/or complete and more work is&nbsp;required).</p>
