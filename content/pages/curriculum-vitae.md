## Research/Professional Experience
* [British Columbia Cancer Agency](http://www.bccrc.ca/), [Terry Fox Laboratory](http://www.terryfoxlab.ca/), Sep. 2011 - Nov. 2012
    * Automated Flow Cytometry Data Analysis - Grad Student
        * Cellular hierarchy optimization for flow cytometry: Problem was modelled onto a graph and finding k-shortest paths
in that graph was equivalent to having the solution. [kBestShortestPaths](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/kBestShortestPaths/index.html) in CRAN 
and [RchyOptimyx](http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/RchyOptimyx.html) in Bioconductor are available as a result
of the study and a paper is submitted to Cytometry A.
        * Classify diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma using flow cytometry experiments: Features were extracted using clustering
as the input of a bootstrap, feature selection, and classifier pipeline.
        * Search for chemotherapy resistant cell populations using pre and post therapy flow experiments: RchyOptimyx pipeline was used to find
cell populations with high enrichment factors, _i.e._ enriched cell populations after therapy that were resistant to chemotherapy.
        * Characterize heterogeneity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Patient samples are clustered into different groups according to their cell populations
and important cell populations in differentiating those clusters are identified.


* [Negin Software Development Co.](http://tosan.com/en/default.aspx), R&D Department, Tehran, Iran, May 2009 - Sep. 2011
    * Fraud detection in Iranian banks - Project Manager
        * Cluster bank employees according to their behavior and detect anomalies.
        * Cluster debit cards according to users transaction behavior and detect anomalies.
    * Operational intelligence - Project Manager
        * Predict terminal type of next user's transaction using transaction history of the user.
        * Soft cluster users according to their fuzzified action times and detect abnormal changes in cluster membership values.
        * Build a graph model to predict geographical position of terminals using transaction history.

* Fidofa Software Group, Financial Research Department, Tehran, Iran, Aug. 2006 - Jun. 2007
