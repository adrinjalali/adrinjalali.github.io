<p>The idea behind this post is not to show how to install the tools you need, or
to list a bunch of [at a first glance seemingly random] <code>git</code> commands. There
are enough tutorials and blog posts explaining them out there in the wild that
with a web search you&#8217;ll find too many of them&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>This goal of this post is to give you the ingredients you need, to contribute
to a project on the GitHub platform and collaborate with other people&nbsp;there.</p>
<p>The first important point is the distinction between <strong>git</strong> and <strong>GitHub</strong>!
GitHub is a platform which uses <code>git</code>, but it&#8217;s also not the only platform that
uses it. Another somewhat similar platform is <strong>GitLab</strong>, but there are crucial
differences between the two that has made GitHub a much more convenient place
for a community of strangers to work together. By far the best source of
information I can recommend is the <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2">Pro Git
book</a>. To keep it practical, I may not strictly
stick to the definitions present in the book; the idea is to get you started
first, then you can cover the concepts more <em>accurately</em> once you have more&nbsp;time.</p>
<p><code>git</code> is a version control system, which&nbsp;is:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files
over time so that you can recall specific versions later<sup id="fnref:f1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:f1">1</a></sup>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Strictly speaking, to develop a package using <code>git</code> there is no need for any
server or a platform. Most <code>git</code> related tasks you&#8217;d be doing are done
completely locally on your own machine&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The main issue at the beginning when you start to work with <code>git</code> is all the
jargon used around it. To get an idea of what we&#8217;re talking about here, the
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a2x1iJFJWc"><span class="caps">GIT</span> Workflow - Georgia Tech - Software Development
Process</a> short video is a great
place to&nbsp;start:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3a2x1iJFJWc" title="GIT Workflow - Georgia Tech - Software Development Process"><img alt="GIT Workflow - Georgia Tech - Software Development
Process" src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/3a2x1iJFJWc/0.jpg"></a></p>
<p>Now let&#8217;s go through some of the concepts you&#8217;d encounter in
almost any project. For the rest of this post, I&#8217;ll be assuming you&#8217;ve
installed <code>git</code> and gone through <a href="https://medium.com/cs-note/git-and-github-for-beginners-i-tutorial-263caa01f9c3">this
tutorial</a>
up to Step 3: setup &#8220;config&#8221;, and know your way around a <em>shell/terminal</em>.</p>
<p><em>Source tree</em> is your project&#8217;s folder, with all its subfolders and files that
are included in the project. Using <code>git</code> you&#8217;ll be keeping track of all the
changes on the source&nbsp;tree.</p>
<p>However, there are always files and folders which you don&#8217;t want to keep track
of, for instance the <code>build</code> directory which keeps compiled binary files of
your project. Cache and temporary files are also another category of files you
would like to exclude from being tracked. The way you tell <code>git</code> to ignore
those is through a <code>.gitignore</code> file usually put in the root of the project&#8217;s
folder. For most programming languages, there are descent <code>.gitignore</code>
templates, for instance you can take a look at the
<a href="https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore">Python.gitignore</a>.
This means <code>git</code> will not automatically start tracking any of the files and/or
folders mentioned in <code>.gitignore</code>, but you can still explicitly tell it to do
so if you wish for a particular file or folder. For instance, you may want to
ignore all <code>.pdf</code> files, but keep a single <code>.pdf</code> in your repository for some
reason. You would be able to do so by explicitly telling <code>git</code> to keep track of&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Once you start tracking changes to your project&#8217;s source tree using <code>git</code>, you
have a <em>git repository</em>. The git repository includes all the history of the
whole project in a <code>.git</code> folder under the root of the project. It&#8217;s worth
noting that by default, every file and folder starting with a dot (<code>.</code>) is a
<em>hidden</em> file/folder under&nbsp;linux.</p>
<p>For the rest of this post, I&#8217;ll be using the screenshots taken at the time of
writing the post. It may slightly change through time as GitHub continues its&nbsp;development.</p>
<p>For the purpose of this tutorial, I&#8217;ve setup an example repository on GitHub,
which you can see under <a href="https://github.com/github-tutorials/example-repo">this
link</a>. At first it&#8217;s almost
empty and it looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><img alt="git/github" src="files/img/git/initial-orig.png"></p>
<p>A few things to notice here&nbsp;are:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a <em>Watch/Unwatch</em> button which takes a few states, and you can use it
  to set the amount of notification you&#8217;d be receiving for the repository. You
  will receive a notification (depending on your settings, it can be an email)
  for each event happening on the repository. If you&#8217;d like to be informed and
  notified of every single post and contribution on the repo, then you&#8217;d want
  to &#8220;<em>watch</em>&#8221; it. For a busy repository like <em>scikit-learn</em>, it can be tens of
  emails a day. By default, you&#8217;ll be notified if there&#8217;s a response to the
  issues and pull requests you&#8217;ve been working on (we&#8217;ll get to them&nbsp;shortly).</li>
<li>If you like to make the contributors and maintainers of the repository happy,
  you should consider &#8220;<em>Star</em>&#8220;ing the&nbsp;repo.</li>
</ul>
<p>The other option up there, is <strong>fork</strong>, which requires a bit of an explanation.
When you have a git repository, you can <strong>clone</strong> that by copying everything
you have on that repo, including the <code>.git</code> folder. So copying is the simplest
type of clone you can have. The clone is the same as the original repository,
including its history (since you copied the <code>.git</code> folder as well). But let say
you want to clone a repository from a server, and every now and then sync your
local copy with what you have on the server. That&#8217;s why you also have a &#8220;clone
or download&#8221; button on your repository, which gives you the address of the
repository which you can use locally to clone using a <code>git</code> command. Here&#8217;s how
you could get the address on the original&nbsp;repository:</p>
<p><img alt="git/github" src="files/img/git/git-clone-orig.png"></p>
<p>And then you&#8217;d be using the following command to clone that repository&nbsp;locally:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git clone https://github.com/github-tutorials/example-repo.git
</code></pre></div>

<p>The above command will download the repository and put it in a folder named the
same as the repo itself (<code>example-repo</code> in this case). At the same time, it
will store the information about from where it got the repository, which is
called a <strong>remote</strong>, and by default this remote is called <em>origin</em>. You can get
a list of your remotes using the following command (after going to your repo&#8217;s&nbsp;folder):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">cd</span> example-repo
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/github-tutorials/example-repo.git <span class="o">(</span>fetch<span class="o">)</span>
origin  https://github.com/github-tutorials/example-repo.git <span class="o">(</span>push<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Again, please note that the above command and all the ones from this point
should be run when you&#8217;re already in your repository&#8217;s folder. As you can see,
there are two identical addressed for two purposes, <em>fetch</em> and <em>push</em>. You can
<em>fetch</em> changes on the repository which have happened on the <em>remote</em> server,
but you don&#8217;t have, using <code>git fetch</code>, and <em>push</em> any changes on your local
machine using <code>git push</code>. But there are a few steps before we can do&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>You may have noticed that we cloned the repository, without telling a
maintainer of the original repo that we&#8217;re doing so. That&#8217;s because the repo is
a <em>public repository</em>. For a <em>private repository</em> you need to be given explicit
permissions by a maintainer/package developer before you can access it.
Basically if you see a repository on GitHub, you can clone&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>However, since you&#8217;re not given explicit permissions, you cannot modify
anything on the original repo, and that also means you cannot do a <code>git push</code>
directly to it. That&#8217;s why you need to <strong>fork</strong> the repository before cloning
it. It&#8217;ll create a server side clone of the repo in your account. You can do
that by simply pushing the &#8220;<em>fork</em>&#8221; button up there. Please note that if you&#8217;re
a member of one or more organizations, it&#8217;ll ask you to choose an organization
where it should create the fork. Your username will be listed there and you
can choose that to create the fork under your own user and not touch any of the
organizations you&#8217;re a member of. Otherwise it&#8217;ll simply create the fork under
your username. This is what you&#8217;ll see once you fork the&nbsp;repo:</p>
<p><img alt="git/github" src="files/img/git/initial-fork.png"></p>
<p>As you can see, it also tells you from where you forked the repository. Now you
have administrative access to this repository, and that&#8217;s why you also see a
&#8220;<em>Settings</em>&#8221; tab. Now if you try to get the clone address of this repo, it
shows you the one you own. Now you have two options, you can delete what you
had cloned, and clone a new one using the new address, which in my case would&nbsp;be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git clone https://github.com/adrinjalali/example-repo.git
</code></pre></div>

<p>Please note that the <code>github-tutorials</code> is changed to <code>adrinjalali</code>, my
username. But you can also manipulate your remotes and change what you have to
the new remote address, and avoid having to delete and redownload the
repository. By convention/default, <code>origin</code> is the remote you own and you sync
your local copy with, and <code>upstream</code> is the original repository you forked.
Every now and then you&#8217;ll be needing to resync your repository with the changes
which have happened on <code>upstream</code>, to keep up with the latest changes. So,
let&#8217;s first rename <code>origin</code> to <code>upstream</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git remote rename origin upstream
</code></pre></div>

<p>And then add the new <code>origin</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git remote add origin https://github.com/adrinjalali/example-repo.git
$ git remote -v
origin  https://github.com/adrinjalali/example-repo.git <span class="o">(</span>fetch<span class="o">)</span>
origin  https://github.com/adrinjalali/example-repo.git <span class="o">(</span>push<span class="o">)</span>
upstream    https://github.com/github-tutorials/example-repo.git <span class="o">(</span>fetch<span class="o">)</span>
upstream    https://github.com/github-tutorials/example-repo.git <span class="o">(</span>push<span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you had first forked and then cloned your own repo, you&#8217;d need to only add
the <code>upstream</code> as a remote, and now you have the ingredients to do&nbsp;so.</p>
<p>Now let say you&#8217;d want to find something to work on, related to this repo.
Usually (but not always), there&#8217;s an issue related what you&#8217;d be working on.
You can either report an issue yourself before starting a change, or you can
pick up an issue and say you&#8217;d like to work on it. The &#8220;<em>issues</em>&#8221; tab on the
original repository (the upstream, not yours) would be the place to start. For
instance, I&#8217;ve added two issues on our example and it looks&nbsp;like:</p>
<p><img alt="git/github" src="files/img/git/issues.png"></p>
<p>Now assume you&#8217;d like to work on the &#8220;Explain what this repository is&#8221; issue.
It states what should be done, and you can leave a comment saying you&#8217;ll fix
it. It&#8217;ll be different for you since you&#8217;re not a member/maintainer of the
repo, but it&#8217;ll look similar to this&nbsp;one:</p>
<p><img alt="git/github" src="files/img/git/issue-1.png"></p>
<p>Please also note that on the right side of the title of the issue, and in the
<span class="caps">URL</span> of the issue, the <span class="caps">ID</span> of the issue is mentioned, which is 1 in this case
(the first issue in the repository); we&#8217;ll get back to it&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>Going back to your local copy of the repo, you can start contributing using a
<em>git workflow</em>, which involves proper <em>branching</em> and <em>merging</em> and so on.
There are different ways you can do that, and with a quick search you&#8217;ll find
proposals such as <a href="https://sandofsky.com/blog/git-workflow.html">this</a>,
<a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows">this</a>, and
<a href="https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/">this</a> one. It&#8217;s good
to go through some of those and familiarize yourself with the process, but it&#8217;s
not a must. Those workflows become more important if a few collaborators start
working on the same repository, which would happen in an organization and
specially on a GitLab platform. However, since you&#8217;ll be doing everything on
your own repository and not the upstream, you can do whatever you want without
disturbing the <em>upstream</em>. Something they all have in common is the concept of
a <strong>branch</strong>. As <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell">the book has
it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nearly every <span class="caps">VCS</span> [(Version Control System)] has some form of branching
support. Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and
continue to do work without messing with that main line. In many <span class="caps">VCS</span> tools,
this is a somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create a new
copy of your source code directory, which can take a long time for large&nbsp;projects.</p>
<p>Some people refer to Git’s branching model as its “killer feature,” and it
certainly sets Git apart in the <span class="caps">VCS</span> community. Why is it so special? The way
Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly
instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally just
as fast. Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages workflows that branch and
merge often, even multiple times in a day. Understanding and mastering this
feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and can entirely change the way
that you&nbsp;develop.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The main branch is always <code>master</code>. Another main branch in a project may be
<code>dev</code>, <code>devel</code>, or <code>develop</code>, but not all projects have it, and it depends on
the kind of <em>workflow</em> they choose to follow. If they choose to have <code>master</code>
very stable and corresponding to the latest release, then the main development
would happen on <code>develop</code>. On the other hand, if they decide to have release
branches and have the main development happen on <code>master</code>, they&#8217;ll probably not
have the <code>develop</code> branch and instead have branches such as <code>v1.2</code>, <code>v1.3</code>,
etc. You usually would need to <em>base</em> your development on the active and under
development branch. When you <em>fork</em> or <em>clone</em> a repository, it also includes
all the branches that repository, and you can simply change to that branch&nbsp;locally.</p>
<p>You can always see the branch you have as active&nbsp;using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, by default you&#8217;re on the <code>master</code> branch. Now since <code>master</code> is
our main development branch, you can base your work on it and create a branch
from it. You can create a branch based on your current active branch&nbsp;using:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git branch <span class="nb">test</span>
$ git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean
$ git branch --list
* master
  <span class="nb">test</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, we created a branch, but still stayed on master. In order to
change to the newly created branch, you should <strong>checkout</strong> the&nbsp;branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git checkout <span class="nb">test</span>
Switched to branch <span class="s1">&#39;test&#39;</span>
$ git branch --list
  master
* <span class="nb">test</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can also go back to <code>master</code>, and safely delete this <code>test</code> branch:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git checkout master
Switched to branch <span class="s1">&#39;master&#39;</span>
$ git branch -D <span class="nb">test</span>
Deleted branch <span class="nb">test</span> <span class="o">(</span>was ea65abd<span class="o">)</span>.
$ git branch --list
* master
</code></pre></div>

<p><code>ea65abd</code> is the <em>abbreviated commit hash</em> which you can ignore for&nbsp;now.</p>
<p>A more convenient way to create a new branch and check it out at the same time
would&nbsp;be:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git checkout -b doc/readme
Switched to a new branch <span class="s1">&#39;doc/readme&#39;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, the name of the new branch is <code>doc/readme</code>. The name can be
almost anything, and one convention that some people follow is to name branches
as <code>category/item</code>, but you could as well do <code>category-item</code>, or
<code>my-random-branch-name</code>. I&#8217;d suggest you always keep your master clean and in
sync with your remote, and only work on branches for each&nbsp;feature/issue.</p>
<p>Now we can finally start working on the issue. This is the <code>README.md</code> now:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ cat README.md 
<span class="c1"># example-repo</span>
example repository <span class="k">for</span> github tutorials
</code></pre></div>

<p>And let&#8217;s change it&nbsp;to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ cat README.md 
<span class="c1"># example-repo</span>
example repository <span class="k">for</span> github tutorials

This repository is made to showcase some common tasks and processes on GitHub
and to present the related <span class="sb">`</span>git<span class="sb">`</span> commands. The post explaining these processes
is located
<span class="o">[</span>here<span class="o">](</span>gitgithub-how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github.html<span class="o">)</span>.
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now let&#8217;s see what the status of the local repo&nbsp;is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git status
On branch doc/readme
Changes not staged <span class="k">for</span> commit:
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git add &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to update what will be committed<span class="o">)</span>
  <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;...&quot;</span> to discard changes in working directory<span class="o">)</span>

    modified:   README.md

no changes added to commit <span class="o">(</span>use <span class="s2">&quot;git add&quot;</span> and/or <span class="s2">&quot;git commit -a&quot;</span><span class="o">)</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>As you can see, it says the <code>README.md</code> file is <strong>modified</strong>. You would need to
<strong>add</strong> the file. That brings us to the lifecycle of a file on a git repo. As
shown in <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository">the
book</a>:</p>
<p><img alt="git/github" src="files/img/git/lifecycle.png"></p>
<p>These are the 4 states a file can have under the&nbsp;repo:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Untracked</em>: the file exists in the project tree, but it&#8217;s not being tracked
  by&nbsp;git.</li>
<li><em>Unmodified</em>: <code>git status</code> won&#8217;t report any of these files, since there has
  been no changes to them since the last <em>snapshot</em> git has taken from them.
  That snapshot happens when you <strong>commit</strong> the changes to&nbsp;files.</li>
<li><em>Modified</em>: the previous version of the file is recorded in the git repo, but
  since then, there has been changes to it, and these changes are not recorded&nbsp;yet.</li>
<li><em>Staged</em>: there has been changes to the file since the last <em>snapshot</em>, and
  these changes are set to be recorded by a <strong>commit</strong>, but that commit hasn&#8217;t
  happened&nbsp;yet.</li>
</ul>
<p>A more comprehensive explanation of how to record changes in the repo can be
found
<a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository">here</a>.</p>
<p>So now we need to move the <code>README.md</code> from <em>modified</em> to <em>staged</em> (using <code>git
add</code>), and then to <em>unmodified</em> (using <code>git commit</code>):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git add README.md
$ git commit -m <span class="s2">&quot;added required changes to the README.md&quot;</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Always include a message with the commit. Meaningful <em>Commit messages</em> are
extremely helpful for later coming back and finding some changes you&#8217;ve made
previously. Alternatively, you could summarize the above two commands in&nbsp;one:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git commit -am <span class="s2">&quot;added required changes to the README.md&quot;</span>
<span class="o">[</span>doc/readme b43f0b6<span class="o">]</span> added required changes to the README.md
 <span class="m">1</span> file changed, <span class="m">5</span> insertions<span class="o">(</span>+<span class="o">)</span>
$ git status
On branch doc/readme
nothing to commit, working tree clean
</code></pre></div>

<p>The difference is that <code>git commit -a</code> adds all modified files to the staging
area, which may not be what you want. For more control you can use the two
separate commands. Also, as you can see, the working tree is <em>clean</em>&nbsp;again.</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s time to <strong>push</strong> the changes to our remote copy of the repository,
which we can do by <code>git push</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><code>$ git push
fatal: The current branch doc/readme has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and <span class="nb">set</span> the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin doc/readme
</code></pre></div>

<p><span class="caps">OOPS</span>, it failed, because there is no corresponding branch on the remote copy
which corresponds to the local branch we&#8217;ve made. Your own remote copy is the
<em>upstream</em> to the local copy, and you see that you need to tell git which
branch on the upstream should be the corresponding one. As you can see, by
default it suggests the same branch name, on the <code>origin</code> remote. The suggested
command would create a new branch on your remote copy, and upload the changes
to that&nbsp;branch:</p>

<p>Your output would be slightly different. Here I had to change my remote and use
the ssh connection instead. Not only it&#8217;s more secure, it also allows you to
interact with your account without the need to enter your username/password
every time you need permissions. You can find the guides to setup that for your
account
<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/">here</a>. I also
recommend activating a two factor authentication (<span class="caps">2FA</span>) for your&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>Now if you go back to your account and check the repository, you&#8217;ll see that a
new branch has been&nbsp;created:</p>
<p><img alt="git/github" src="files/img/git/github-branches.png"></p>
<p>Now that you have the changes on your account, you can go ahead and create the
first <strong>pull request</strong>. It basically means you&#8217;d send a request to the
maintainers of the repository to pull the changes you&#8217;ve made, from your repo
into the original repo. For that, you also need to specify your <code>doc/readme</code>
branch as the <em>from</em> branch, and the <em>master</em> on the original repo as the <em>to</em>
branch. Please note that it would be the <em>develop</em> branch on the upstream repo
if that was what you based your changes on. But in this case, we based the
changes on the <code>master</code> branch of the upstream&nbsp;repo.</p>
<p>Now you could click on the &#8220;<em>Compare <span class="amp">&amp;</span> pull request</em>&#8221; button, or you could go
to the upstream repository, then <em>Pull requests</em> (<span class="caps">PR</span>), and then <em>New pull
request</em>, which brings you to a page where you can explain what the does and
then create&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Once you create the <span class="caps">PR</span>, you can wait for reviewers to review your <span class="caps">PR</span>, which
usually means they&#8217;ll ask you to change a few things. To apply those changes,
you don&#8217;t need to create a new <span class="caps">PR</span> or a new branch, you simply need to be sure
you&#8217;re on the same branch as before, apply your changes, commit to your local
clone (<code>git add</code>, <code>git commit</code> commands), and then push (<code>git push</code>). This will
add your changes to your existing <span class="caps">PR</span>.</p>
<p>I hope this helps a few people a little bit. I&#8217;d be happy to get some feedback
and see if it&#8217;s helpful or&nbsp;not.</p>
