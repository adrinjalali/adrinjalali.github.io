Classify diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and follicular lymphoma using flow cytometry experiments: Features were extracted using clustering as the input of a bootstrap, feature selection, and classifier pipeline. Search for chemotherapy resistant cell populations using pre and post therapy flow experiments: RchyOptimyx pipeline was used to find cell populations with high enrichment factors, i.e. enriched cell populations after therapy that were resistant to chemotherapy. Characterize heterogeneity in chronic lymphocytic leukemia: Patient samples are clustered into different groups according to their cell populations and important cell populations in differentiating those clusters are identified.

Where Since December 2012, I live in Saarbrücken, Germany, employed by Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science in Prof. Dr. Dr. Thomas Lengauer's group . Area of research I use/design machine learning tools to classify samples. The datasets I work on vary from microarray to DNA methylation data. I am mostly focused on using gene/protein networks in order to help the classification task, while keeping in mind I need to interpret my results for a biologist. Therefore my goal at the moment is to have a method which directly uses or is inspired by the biological networks, classifies my samples, and can be interpreted on the biological level. [ Poster ] Adrin Jalali, Nico Pfeifer, \" Analyzing How Protein Interaction Networks Improve Classification Performance in Gene Expression Data Analysis \", ISMB / ECCB 2013, Berlin, Germany. I also worked on flow-cytometry data which is a single cell level data. I did it mostly when I was for 15 months in Vancouver, Canada, and I was doing research in British Columbia Cancer Research Center and The University of British Columbia .

I got help from a bunch of pages like this and this one. This comes after you fix the external LDAP authentication and probably also external GAL configuration on your Zimbra server. zmprov gives you a nice terminal to configure the server: $ su - zimbra $ zmprov This is the set of commands I used to set it up: prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvAccountNameMap \"uid\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvAttrMap \"givenName=givenName\" prov> md mysampledomain.net +zimbraAutoProvAttrMap \"sn=sn\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvBatchSize 80 prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvLdapAdminBindDn \"uid=mail_server,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=mysampledomain,dc=net\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvLdapAdminBindPassword \"myverysecretpassword\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvLdapBindDn \"uid=mail_server,cn=users,cn=accounts,dc=mysampledomain,dc=net\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvLdapSearchBase \"cn=accounts,dc=mysampledomain,dc=net\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvLdapSearchFilter \"(&(ObjectClass=person))\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvLdapStartTlsEnabled TRUE prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvLdapURL \"ldaps://ipa.mysampledomain.net:636\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvPollingInterval \"10m\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvScheduledDomains \"mysampledomain.net\" prov> md mysampledomain.net zimbraAutoProvMode \"EAGER\" To diagnose why the system wasn't working, I also had to figure out where the log files are, and how to produce more logs. Oddly enough, they're not in /var/log , and instead they are written by default in /opt/zimbra/log/mailbox.log , or other related files in that folder. I added log4j.logger.zimbra.autoprov=TRACE at the end of my /opt/zimbra/conf/log4j.properties file, which will be overwritten next time I restart the services using the configurations in /opt/zimbra/conf/log4j.properties.in . Finally to make the logging system reload the logging configuration, you need to run zmprov rlog . You find more info here .","tags":"sysadmin","loc":"http://adrin.info/zimbra-auto-provisioning-from-freeipa.html","title":"Zimbra Auto Provisioning from FreeIPA"},{"text":"I decided to actually write on this blog (decision was made this morning and is final :D ). On June 2nd I received an email from my adviser telling me about the DREAM Challenges . I kind of liked it as some sub-challenges fit exactly what I've been doing for that past few months, and that project is already in a phase that we've submitted a manuscript about it. So why not? Going through their pages, I realized they've got a python client to interact with their databases; that's cool, but it didn't support python 3. As a result I made this pull request and at the moment of writing this post, they seem to be interested in accepting the commits (although the changes are not perfect and/or complete and more work is required). Later I was reading challenge descriptions which made me interact with the website for a while, and that made me a bit frustrated. I have to say, I'm not a web-developer and I'm talking as a simple end user. If I was the web-site's development manager, I'd add these to the first possible sprint : Add a proper navigation system to the website; currently you can only easily navigate within a challenge/project. You need to go to the home page first to go anywhere else. Try to go to DREAM challenges, you need to go to the home page, wait for that timer based frame to come which has the link to the challenge, click on it. In my browser (chromium), I have to refresh the whole page if I miss it once, or wait for it to come again. So: add proper links, menus, or whatever you think suits the framework for a nice navigation to projects. Within a challenge description page, click on a link and the whole page will be reloaded, slowly and painfully. For some reason the layout of the page changes through time after each part of the page is loaded. A simple markdown based static website works much faster and better, if you want it to be fancy, add proper AJAX components/codes to make it smooth and fast. The website has serious performance issues and seems unnecessarily heavy. I'm pretty sure developers have their reason for having the website the way it is, but those reasons must be justified/changed.","tags":"misc","loc":"http://adrin.info/synapseorg.html","title":"synapse.org"}]}
