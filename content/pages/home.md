### Who
You are surfing _Adrin Jalali_'s page, who works in the responsible / ethical
AI field as a data scientist/data science consultant and did a PhD in
Computational Biology, specifically machine learning in cancer diagnostics.
He's also a [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and a
[fairlearn](https://fairlearn.org/) core developer.

### Work
These days I work on responsible and ethical AI, helping teams understand the
risks, their potential unwanted biases, and to mitigate them. My work on
scikit-learn, fairlearn, and model cards is certainly going in this way.

In the past I've worked as a consultant solving different problems for
different projects, such as NLP and time series related projects. I've led
multiple teams, been the product owner, scrum master, and tech lead in various
past lives.

During my PhD I worked on disease/patient related data and I became more and
more interested in healthcare related issues. I still work every now and then
on healthcare projects and issues, and maybe I get back to it one day.


### Want to Hire Me?
I'm always open to opportunities which are related to projects improving
people's lives, or are purely technical and related to infrastructure used by
teams to do their work (my open source work is in this category). I love
building communities, to cherish them, and to help them grow, and I learn a ton
from those people doing so.

When choosing teammates, I rather go for a team where people bring different
perspectives to the table rather than people who are strong individuals.
Diversity is a quite important aspect for me in this regard.


### Area of research
I used/designed machine learning tools to classify samples. The datasets I
worked on vary from microarray to DNA methylation data. I was mostly focused on
using gene/protein networks in order to help the classification task, while
keeping in mind I need to interpret my results for a biologist. Therefore my
goal was to have a method which directly uses or is inspired by the biological
networks, classifies my samples, and can be interpreted on the biological
level.

I also worked on flow-cytometry data which is a single cell level data. I did
it mostly when I was for 15 months in Vancouver, Canada, and I was doing
research in [British Columbia Cancer Research Center](http://www.bccrc.ca/) and
[The University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/). As a result of this
part of my research, I can refer you to:
