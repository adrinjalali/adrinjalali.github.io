A weekend in October (15-17.10.2017), on the side of the [9th World Health Summit (WHS)[https://www.worldhealthsummit.org/whs-2017.html] I attended a hackathon called [Hacking Global Health](https://www.kfw-entwicklungsbank.de/International-financing/KfW-Development-Bank/Topics/Health/Hacking-Global-Health/). We were nearly 40 people, in around 20 teams, and each team had to pitch an idea in 2 minutes. The only constraint on the ideas were that it had to do with improving health in poor urban areas. The trick was that only 8 of these teams were supposed to go to the "next" round and develop those ideas for the final pitch. But that was supposed to happen organically, without any interference from any judges or organizers. This meant that we had around 15 minutes or so, to form 8 teams, on our own. The organizers, however, tried to push people with different backgrounds into the same teams, such that each team has all the required skills.

This is how I ended up in a team which needed somebody with "IT" background. They were people from two different teams, one with a focus on malaria mosquito traps, the other focusing on plague carrying rats. So I abandoned my idea, and we joined forces to come up with something. A bit later two more joined us with a business background.

After merging two of the ideas, we came up with a platform to educate people and improve their situation regarding vector borne diseases. It was a fantastic experience for me, since I didn't even know this meaning of the word "vector" beforehand. Our team was fantastically open about the ideas, and that's why we ended up with an idea which was none of the original ideas, but an idea covering two of the original ones. The final idea was so different from any of the original ideas, that we had to resubmit a pitch form for them to put it in the list of final pitches.

The idea is a platform which gives information about vectors and their related diseases to the users, and it receives information about those vectors from the users and other sources such as government organizations or research institutes. It has different faces:
 - A smartphone app which enables the community to report potential breeding sites such as potholes and communicate with each other in order to potentially take action and fix them. They also receive information about vectors and diseases most relevant to them.
 - A web interface/API enabling different organizations to interact with the platform and use the data uploaded by the users.
 
 What we came up with, as the imaginary prototype of the app, looks like this:
