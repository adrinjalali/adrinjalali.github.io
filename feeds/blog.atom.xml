&lt;p&gt;This was my first &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has been happening
in Brussels every year for the past 20 years! It&amp;#8217;s kind of a mostly talk based
hacker space with no registration required for the attendees. This year the
estimate was 5000 attendees each day, and that doesn&amp;#8217;t include the …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="fosdem20" src="https://fosdem.org/2020/assets/2020cake-e330eb83a6c466bcd67e7cb3291985576c4fd4f43ff954053ec0acf6c00991ab.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was my first &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOSDEM&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which has been happening
in Brussels every year for the past 20 years! It&amp;#8217;s kind of a mostly talk based
hacker space with no registration required for the attendees. This year the
estimate was 5000 attendees each day, and that doesn&amp;#8217;t include the fringe
events happening around the main event. The &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/fringe/"&gt;fringe
itself&lt;/a&gt; has tons of events and I managed to
attend one or&amp;nbsp;two.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The whole thing has an interesting format; you have the main organization team
and then the dev rooms, all handled by volunteers, and with a perfectly
functional delegation system. The dev room volunteers have complete control
over what happens there, given a few general rules and principles like fire
safety and a&amp;nbsp;CoC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to see that they had very few sponsors, and most sponsors
would contribute through service rather than money, &lt;em&gt;e.g.&lt;/em&gt; providing the venue,
or the cabling system or the recycled laptops to process the&amp;nbsp;videos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another point which I&amp;#8217;d like to take to PyData conferences is that the video
review was done predominantly by speakers. I received an email after my talk, I
then suggested exact start/finish times, audio channel, etc., and with all that
your video would be up and done within an hour after your&amp;nbsp;talk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s truly impressive to see what they&amp;#8217;ve done with volunteer work and minimal
external services. It&amp;#8217;s also interesting from a planning point of view that
they manage the whole thing w/o ever knowing who&amp;#8217;s coming and how many. Of
course there are long lines behind most of the dev room doors waiting to get
in, but usually you wouldn&amp;#8217;t wait for more than a talk&amp;#8217;s time long and that was
mostly around half an&amp;nbsp;hour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One thing which stroke me was the poor gender diversity of the conference and
the speakers. The Python room for instance, where I gave my talk, had 0 female
speakers. The diversity wasn&amp;#8217;t much better among attendees either, and it was
worse in some rooms than&amp;nbsp;others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were two events/rooms which I particularly found interesting and met a
ton of really cool people in them were the
&lt;a href="https://chaoss.community/chaosscon-2020-eu/"&gt;CHAOScon&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/track/community_devroom/"&gt;community dev
room&lt;/a&gt;. We had really
interesting discussions and talks about how to build a community around a
project, how to measure community&amp;#8217;s health, and how to sustain it. Most
definitely useful for the communities I&amp;#8217;m involved&amp;nbsp;with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also gave a talk on &lt;a href="https://fosdem.org/2020/schedule/event/python2020_scikit_learn_estimator/"&gt;How to write a scikit-learn compatible
estimator/transformer&lt;/a&gt;
with the
&lt;a href="https://mirrors.dotsrc.org/fosdem/2020/UA2.252A/python2020_scikit_learn_estimator.webm"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;
and the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/adrinjalali/talks/blob/master/sklearn-estimator-fosdem-2020/custom_estimators.ipynb"&gt;material&lt;/a&gt;
both available. It was the first time I presented something (other than
opening/closing remarks of a conference) to ~500 people. It was such a pleasure
and privilege to do&amp;nbsp;so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#8217;ll try to be more engaged with the community related communities next
year if I end up going, and should definitely plan my time better. It&amp;#8217;s
overwhelming and exhausting to try and figure things out there. The talks are
also all live streamed, that&amp;#8217;s also something to&amp;nbsp;use.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="conference"></category><category term="community"></category></entry><entry><title>synapse.org</title><link href="https://adrin.info/synapseorg.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-06-10T00:00:00+02:00</published><updated>2014-06-10T00:00:00+02:00</updated><author><name>adrin</name></author><id>tag:adrin.info,2014-06-10:/synapseorg.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I decided to actually write on this blog (decision was made this morning and is final :D&amp;nbsp;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On June 2nd I received an email from my adviser telling me about the &lt;a href="https://www.synapse.org/Portal.html#!Challenges:DREAM"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DREAM&lt;/span&gt; Challenges&lt;/a&gt;. I kind of liked it as some sub-challenges fit exactly what I&amp;#8217;ve been doing for that past few months, and that project is already in a phase that we&amp;#8217;ve submitted a manuscript about it. So why&amp;nbsp;not?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going through their pages, I realized they&amp;#8217;ve got a python client to interact with their databases; that&amp;#8217;s cool, but it didn&amp;#8217;t support python 3. As a result I made &lt;a href="https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/synapsePythonClient/pull/150"&gt;this pull request&lt;/a&gt; and at the moment of writing this post, they seem to be interested in accepting the commits (although the changes are not perfect and/or complete and more work is&amp;nbsp;required).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later I was reading challenge descriptions which made me interact with the website for a while, and that made me a bit frustrated. I have to say, I&amp;#8217;m not a web-developer and I&amp;#8217;m talking as a simple end&amp;nbsp;user.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I was the web-site&amp;#8217;s development manager, I&amp;#8217;d add these to the first possible &lt;a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/articles/2007/march/glossary-of-scrum-terms#1118"&gt;sprint&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Add a proper navigation system to the website; currently you can only easily navigate within a challenge/project. You need to go to the home page first to go anywhere&amp;nbsp;else.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try to go to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DREAM&lt;/span&gt; challenges, you need to go to the home page, wait for that timer based frame to come which has the link to the challenge, click on it. In my browser (chromium), I have to refresh the whole page if I miss it once, or wait for it to come again. So: add proper links, menus, or whatever you think suits the framework for a nice navigation to&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Within a challenge description page, click on a link and the whole page will be reloaded, slowly and painfully. For some reason the layout of the page changes through time after each part of the page is loaded. A simple markdown based static website works much faster and better, if you want it to be fancy, add proper &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AJAX&lt;/span&gt; components/codes to make it smooth and fast. The website has serious performance issues and seems unnecessarily&amp;nbsp;heavy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m pretty sure developers have their reason for having the website the way it is, but those reasons must be&amp;nbsp;justified/changed.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="blog"></category><category term="dream-challenge"></category></entry></feed>
