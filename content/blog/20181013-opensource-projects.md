When looking for a project to which you'd like to contribute, there are two
major aspects you may want to consider. One is the way it's released and
managed, and the other is the community around it.

The way I see the first aspect, it's like a spectrum. Closed source proprietary
software on one side (let say the right side), and community driven and fully 
transparent and open
sourced project on the other side (let say the left side).
And it's important to realize that different
projects are somewhere on this spectrum, and not necessarily on either of the
two ends; let aside the whole licensing issue which itself complicates matters
by another order of magnitude.

Sometimes companies "release" the source code of a product, or a part of a
product. Microsoft does this pretty often. You can only look at the code; you
can't run it, you can't use it, and most people won't. To me it's more like a
public relations thing. They use it as a tool to gain reputation among the
community. I see such examples as the ones pretty close the right side of the
spectrum.

Going slightly to the left side of the spectrum, there are projects which are
"released" as a whole, and they may even include a friendly license letting
you use it under certain conditions. They may even have a GitHub account and
dump the source code there. Some of these projects are released once, and never
maintained further, and some go through periodical releases; but they still
keep the public and the community mostly in dark about the development of the
new features. They usually also don't really welcome contributions from
"outsiders", and that's not because they don't like contributions; it's mostly
due to the fact that they have limited amount of resources and their priorities
are dictated by the products in which these pieces of software are used.
