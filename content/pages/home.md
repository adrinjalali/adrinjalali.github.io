#### Who
You are surfing _Adrin Jalali_'s page, who is currently doing research in the field of 
computational biology, with the aim of hopefully getting a PhD.

#### Where
Since December 2012, I live in Saarbrücken, Germany, employed by [Max-Planck Institute for Computer Science](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/)
in [Prof. Dr. Dr. Thomas Lengauer's group](http://www.mpi-inf.mpg.de/departments/d3/index.html).

#### Area of research
I use/design machine learning tools to classify samples. The datasets I work on vary from
microarray to DNA methylation data. I am mostly focused on using gene/protein networks
in order to help the classification task, while keeping in mind I need to interpret
my results for a biologist. Therefore my goal at the moment is to have a method which
directly uses or is inspired by the biological networks, classifies my samples, and
can be interpreted on the biological level.

I also worked on flow-cytometry data which is a single cell level data. I did it mostly
when I was for 15 months in Vancouver, Canada, and I was doing research in [British Columbia
Cancer Research Center](http://www.bccrc.ca/) and [The University of British Columbia](http://www.ubc.ca/).
As a result of this part of my research, I can refer you to:
